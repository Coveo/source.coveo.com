If you're one of the many passangers on the deep learning hype-train (welcome aboard), you've at some point almost certainly experienced the great confusion of having to choose a deep learning framework.

If you're trying to choose a framework, or maybe re-evaluating your choices, I might be able to help! 

I've done a lot of the leg work for you, having made a pretty comprehensive report on the state of DL frameworks that compares their strengths and weaknesses.

<!-- more -->

I compared these frameworks based on three categories that we value most (Support & Community, Internals, and Platform), and used (as much as possible) quantitative measures to compare each one.

Without further ado, let's meet the frameworks.

## The Belidgerents 

This isn't an exauhstive list of *all deep learning frameworks in existence&trade;*, but it's a pretty comprehensive list of frameworks that have either (1) some sort of following or (2) interesting properties.

## Final Results
I'm going to cut straight to the chase and show you what the final scores are for each framework.
