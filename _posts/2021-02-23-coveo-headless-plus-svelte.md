I have been recently trying some new technologies, such as our own [Coveo Headless Library](https://docs.coveo.com/en/headless), which aims to replace Coveo JavaScript Search Framework with a smaller headless state management library, and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), which aims at writing less and clearer code to achieve the same results as a React or VueJS app.

Those two technologies are so great and fun to work with that I could not wait to use them together. So this blog post will do exactly that: Let's build a very simple search page using Svelte and the Headless library.

<!-- more -->

## Setting up the repository

For this example, we will use [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/), a small framework that builds a Svelte app with many modern features such as Server-side rendered pages, which is very useful for SEO in Commerce.

```cmd
npx degit "sveltejs/sapper-template#rollup" coveo-svelte-headless
cd coveo-svelte-headless
npm install @coveo/headless
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can now open `localhost:3000` and directly edit the files, with hot-reload support! Yes, this is already very impressive.

Now, let's remove some of the code that will not really be needed in `index.svelte`, which now looks like this:

```svelte
<svelte:head>
  <title>Coveo Headless + Svelte</title>
</svelte:head>

<div>Hello from Coveo</div>
```

We are now ready to integrate Headless!

## Creating the Engine

The first thing to do is to create a Headless engine. This engine holds the state of a single Search Interface.

For this blog, we will use the sample configuration:

```js
// components/SearchEngine.ts

import { HeadlessEngine, searchAppReducers } from '@coveo/headless';

export const searchEngine = new HeadlessEngine({
  configuration: HeadlessEngine.getSampleConfiguration(),
  reducers: searchAppReducers
});
```

## Creating the Controllers

We must then create a controller to interact with that engine's state.

```js
// components/SearchBox.ts

import { SearchBox, buildSearchBox } from '@coveo/headless';
import {searchEngine} from "./SearchEngine";

export const searchBoxController = buildSearchBox(searchEngine);
```

The `buildSearchBox` method creates a controller for a search box. It exposes a couple of methods such as `updateText` to update the currently typed text, and `submit` to submit a query.

It would be nice to leverage Svelte's store management system, so let's subscribe to the controller's state and expose it:

```js
// components/SearchBox.js

import { buildSearchBox } from '@coveo/headless';
import { searchEngine } from "./SearchEngine";
import { writable } from "svelte/store";

export const searchBoxController = buildSearchBox(searchEngine);
export const searchBoxState = writable(searchBoxController.state);
searchBoxController.subscribe(() => searchBoxState.set(searchBoxController.state));
```

In Svelte, a `writable` store is a value that can be listened to. You can subscribe to the store by using the (very convenient) `$` syntax, such as `$searchBoxState.results`. Each time the state changes, anything that uses `$searchBoxState` will be re-rendered accordingly.

Now, it would not be very useful to have only a search box without seeing the results, so let's do the same with a result list:

```js
// components/ResultList.js

import { buildResultList } from '@coveo/headless';
import { searchEngine } from "./SearchEngine";
import { writable } from "svelte/store";

export const resultListController = buildResultList(searchEngine);
export const resultListState = writable(resultListController.state);
resultListController.subscribe(() => resultListState.set(resultListController.state));
```

## Creating the Svelte Components

And here comes the fun part, wrapping those states and controllers into Svelte components:

```svelte
// components/SearchBox.svelte
<script>
  import { searchBoxController } from "./SearchBox.js";

  let text = "";
  $: searchBoxController.updateText(text);

  function handleKeyUp(e) {
    if (e.key === "Enter") {
      searchBoxController.submit();
    }
  }
</script>

<input bind:value={text} on:keyup={handleKeyUp} />
```

For those unfamiliar with Svelte, the language makes a clear distinction between `const` and `let`, where `let` are *reactive* variables. Meaning that each time the value changes, anything that renders it will trigger a re-render.

The `$:` syntax makes it so any reactive variable that changes will trigger this line, so reassigning `text` would call `updateText` here. Pretty neat!

We then use the `bind:value={text}` syntax to ensure that any letter typed in the input is replicated in the `text` variable. Again, pretty neat!

We are now ready to create our simple ResultList Svelte component:

```svelte
// components/ResultList.svelte
<script>
  import { resultListState } from "./ResultList.js";
</script>

<div>
  {#if $resultListState.results.length === 0}
    {#if $resultListState.loading}
      <span>Loading...</span>
    {:else}
      <div>No Results</div>
    {/if}
  {:else}
    {#each $resultListState.results as { clickUri, title }}
      <div>
        <a href={clickUri}>{title}</a>
      </div>
    {/each}
  {/if}
</div>
```

Here, we import the store and simply listen to it! No rocket science at play here, but the `#each` block might need some explaining. It will iterate over the results and render the HTML template for each result. The `as { clickUri, title }` syntax is simply extracting the two keys from each result by using [Object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#object_destructuring). I think the resulting code is surprisingly pretty clean and readable!

## Integrating the components back into the Search Page

Now, let's integrate those two components in our home page:

```svelte
// routes/index.svelte

<script>
  import SearchBox from "../components/SearchBox.svelte";
  import ResultList from "../components/ResultList.svelte";
</script>

<svelte:head>
  <title>Coveo Headless + Svelte</title>
</svelte:head>

<div>
  <SearchBox />
  <ResultList />
</div>
```

Click on the search box, hit Enter, and:

![Coveo Headless and Svelte Result]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-02-23-coveo-plus-svelte/coveo-plus-svelte-result.png)

That's it!

## Next Steps

This was a very quick introduction to both libraries, but you can see how easy it is to use both and what a great match they are together.

There is still a lot of work to do to make it usable in the real world, though.

### Styling

Styling is very easy in Svelte. It is coded directly in the components, all you have to do is create a `style` tag directly in your Svelte file and start using its classes! Note that all classes are scoped by components by design! See the [Svelte documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs#style) for more details.

### Implementing Other Headless Features and Controllers

There are many more features we could implement here, such as query suggestions (which is already integrated in the `Searchbox` controller) or more specific ones, such as the [Commerce Cart Recommender](https://docs.coveo.com/en/headless/0.1.0/reference/controllers/cart-recommendations/). I would encourage you to explore the [Headless Reference](https://docs.coveo.com/en/headless/0.1.0/reference/) and find the ones that you would like to implement.
