Here at coveo we are using [Prometheus 2](https://prometheus.io/) for collecting all our monitoring metrics. It's known for being able to handle millions of time series with few resources. So when our pod was hiting its 30Gi memory limit we decided to dive into it to understand how memory is allocated.

<!-- more -->

Recently we ran in an issue were our prometheus pod was killed by kubenertes because it was reaching its 30Gi memory limit. Which was surprising considering the numbers of metrics we were collecting.
For comparison, benchmarks for a typical Prometheus installation usually look something like this :

* 800 microservice  + k8s
* 120 000 sample/second
* 300 000 active time series
* 3 Go of ram

Us :

* 640 target
* 20 000 sample/second
* 1 M active time series ( sum(scrape_samples_scraped) )
* 5,5 M total time series
* 40Go of ram

But first let's take a quick overview of Prometheus 2 and its storage ([tsdb v3](https://github.com/prometheus/tsdb)).

## Vocabulary

**Datapoint** : Tuple composed of a timestamp and a value.

**Metric** : specifies the general feature of a system that is measured (e.g. http_requests_total - the total number of HTTP requests received).

**Time series** : Set of datapoint in a unique combinaison of a metric name and labels set. For instance, here are 3 different time series from the up metric:
```
Ex:
up{endpoint="9106",instance="100.99.226.5:9106",job="cw-exp-efs-pp",namespace="infrastructure",pod="cw-exp-efs-pp-74f9898c48-4r9p5",service="cw-exp-efs-pp"}	
up{endpoint="9115",instance="100.100.99.15:9115",job="blackbox-exporter",namespace="monitoring",pod="blackbox-exporter-7848648fd5-ndrtk",service="blackbox-exporter"}	
up{endpoint="9115",instance="100.106.50.198:9115",job="blackbox-exporter",namespace="monitoring",pod="blackbox-exporter-7848648fd5-mqjjf",service="blackbox-exporter"}
```

**Target** : Monitoring endpoint that expose metrics in the prometheus format

**Chunk** : Batch of scraped time series.

**Series churn** : Describe that a set of time series becomes inactive, i.e. receives no more data points, and a new set of active series appears instead. Rolling updates can create this kind of situation.

**Blocks** : A fully independent database containing all time series data for its time window. Hence, it has its own index and set of chunk files.

**Head Block** : The currently open block where all incoming chunks are written.

**Sample** : A collection of all datapoint grabs on a target in one scrape.

## Prometheus Storage (tsdb)

### Storage

When prometheus scrape a target it retrieve thousands of metrics, which will be compacted into chunk and stored in block before being written on disk. Only the head block is writable, all other blocks are immutable. By default, a block contain 2h of data.

To prevent data loss, all incoming data is also written to a temporary write ahead log, which is a set of files in the `wal` directory, from which we can re-populate the in-memory database on restart.

While the head block is kept in memory, blocks containing older blocks are accessed through mmap(). This system call act like the swap, it will link a memory region to a file. This means we can treat all contents of the database as if they were in memory without occupying any physical RAM, but also means you need to allocate plenty of memory for OS Cache if you want to query data older than fits in the head block.

### Compactions

The head block is flushed to disk periodically, while at the same time, compactions to merge a few blocks together are performed to avoid the need to scan too many blocks for queries.

The `wal` files are only deleted once the head chunk has been flushed to disk.

## Investigation

### Usage evaluation

**Disk usage**

needed_disk_space = retention_time_seconds * ingested_samples_per_second * bytes_per_sample (~2B)

360 * 3600 * 20000 * 2 = 51 Go

**Maximum Ram usage**

Needed_ram = number_of_serie_in_head * 8Kb (approximate size of a time series. number of value store in it are not so important because it's only delta from previous value)

5 500 000 * 8 = 44 Go

### Analyze memory usage

Prometheus expose [Go](https://golang.org/) [profiling tools](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/), so let see what we have.

```

First, we see that the memory usage is only 10 Gb which means all the remaining 30GB used is, in fact, the cached memory allocated by mmap.

Secondly we see that we have a huge amount of memory used by labels which indicate a probably high cardinality issue. High cardinality mean a metrics using a label which has plenty of different value

### Analyze labels usage

The tsdb binary has an `analyze` option which can retrieve many useful statistics on the tsdb database.

So we decided to copy the disk storing our data from prometheus and mount it on a dedicated instance to run the analyze.

```

We can see that the monitoring of one of the Kubernetes service(kubelet) seems to generate a lot of churn (which is normal considering that it expose all of the container metrics and that container rotate often ) and that the id label has an high cardinality.

## Actions

Here, the only action we will take will be to dropping the `id` label which doesn't bring any interesting information.

### DEV

**Before optimization**

**After**

### PROD

After applying optimization, sample rate has been divided by 4
![](/images/2019-05-17-prometheus-memory/image2019-5-13_15-27-4.png)

Pod memory usage has been immediately divided by 2 after deploying our optimization and is now at 8 Gb which represent a 375% improvement of the memory usage.

## What we learned

* Labels in metrics have more impact on the memory usage than the metrics itself.
* Memory seen by docker is not the memory really used by prometheus.
* Go profiling is a nice debugging tool.
