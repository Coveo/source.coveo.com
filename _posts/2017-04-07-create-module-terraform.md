_There are multiple ways to use Terraform and manage the code. Ugly or beautiful ways_

It is easy to create Terraform code, plan, apply and push it in a repo. But can you share your code? Can you use it in another AWS region? Can you merge your shared code without breaking anything?

## Build a module

In many programming languages, the way to have sharable code is the modules. Terraform also supports code as module, and guess what? It is really easy to write one.

We already saw in the [introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url %}) that when you use Terraform in a directory, it will read all file prefixed by tf. It is the same thing in a module except that they are multiple folders. If I take the same example as in the [introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url %}), we will create a module to handling an AWS security group.

This is our module files hierarchy
```
-/serurity-group <-- module folder
 --| main.tf  <-- Terraform code
```

In the main.tf, nothing new, a piece of code to create a security group.

```bash
# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "demotf" {
  name        = "demotf"
  description = "A security group for demotf"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["192.168.0.0/16"]
  }
}
```
Congratulations! You created your first module!

To use it, we need a terraform file. Create a file named `infra.tf`.
```
-/serurity-group
 --| main.tf  
|infra.tf
```
It this file, we will call our module
```bash
# infra.tf
 module "security_group" {
   source = "./serurity-group" # <-- relative path to our module folder
 }
```
Test the plan, you should see the creation of a security group.

The source variable can be a local directory, a git or mercurial repository, http urls, s3 bucket. If you use a repository, you can specify a branch, commit, tag(version), etc.

We have a module, but it is not really modular.  Adding some variables will make it more modular. Let's make it that way.

First, our `infra.tf`. We add the `name` argument in our module definition.
```bash
# infra.tf
 module "security_group" {
   source = "./serurity-group"

   name = "SG-Demo" #<-- you can name the variable like you want
 }
```

Now we have to add it to the module. Add a file named `interfaces.tf`.

The name has no importance. Remember, Terraform will get all tf files. One of the best practices I can give you, is to name your entry point `main.tf` and your module interface definition in "interfaces.tf", this one will contain variables and output, kind of like an Oriented Object interface.

```bash
-/serurity-group
 --| main.tf
 --| interfaces.tf  
|infra.tf
```

```bash
# interfaces.tf
variable "name" {
  description = "Name for the security group."
}
```

It is important to add descriptions. When you are first missing a variable and try a terraform plan, Terraform will ask you to set the variable and display the description. This can be a great help when somebody will use our module without knowing what it does.

```bash
terraform plan
var.name
  Name for the security group.

  Enter a value:
```

We can use this variable in our module with the prefix var.

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "demotf" {
  name        = "${var.name}"
  description = "A security group for ${var.name}"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["192.168.0.0/16"]
  }
}
```

Now, we can add a new security group without coping all code. Okay, a security groups with same permissions as another have no reason to exist, but it is just for the example.
```bash
# infra.tf
module "security_group" {
 source = "./security-group"

 name = "SG-Demo"
}

module "security_group2" { #<-- module can't have the same name
 source = "./security-group"

 name = "SG-Demo2"
}
```

We call the security group module twice, and in the security group we set the provider. So we set the provider 2 times. Right now, we just call one module in our infra.tf and I think you will have more than one module in your AWS infrastructure. We don't want to set the provider in each module.

The solution is easy: remove the provider to module ...

```bash
resource "aws_security_group" "demotf" {
  name        = "${var.name}"
  description = "A security group for ${var.name}"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["192.168.0.0/16"]
  }
}
```
... and put it in infra.tf
```bash
# infra.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

module "security_group" {
 source = "./security-group"

 name = "SG-Demo"
}

module "security_group2" {
 source = "./security-group"

 name = "SG-Demo2"
}
```

All the modules will inherit the provider. Warning: it does not working for variables. If you create a variable on `infra.tf`, it will be inaccessible from the module,  if you don't define it in the definition.

So, we have a module that will create two security groups in a region. A nice module can be region agnostic, to allow transforming our `infra.tf` to a module and adding the region as variable.

First, we change the hierarchy: `infra` is our module, and `security group` is a submodule.
```bash
/infra
--| main.tf #<-- Rename infra.tf to main.tf
--| interfaces.tf #<-- Add variable for region
--/serurity-group
  --| main.tf
  --| interfaces.tf  
```

```bash
variable "region" {
  default = 'us-east-1'
  description = "AWS region where all resources will be create."
}
```
As you can see, we added a default value. This way,  Terraform will not ask us to set a region and we can override this variable.

Add the `region` variable in the `provider`.

```bash
# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "${var.region}"
}

module "security_group" {
 source = "./security-group"

 name = "SG-Demo"
}

module "security_group2" {
 source = "./security-group"

 name = "SG-Demo2"
}
```

Finally, we have a region agnostic module to create the base of our new infrastructure. You can add all the resources you need.

## Override

If we want to create the same infra in another region, we just have to override the region. Terraform has multiple ways to override it: by an environment variable, adding it in your command `terraform`, adding a variable file, etc.

Our favorite solution is  to add a variable file (.tfvars). In our case we have just one variable but as you can imagine there will be more than one. And a file containing all variables in a file is the most elegant solution.

Add a file `us-east-2.tfvars` at the root of your module `infra`.
```bash
# us-east-2.tfvars
region = "us-east-2"
```

And call Terraform with the `-var-file` parameter.
````bash
terraform plan -var-file=us-east-2.tfvars
```
This way, the region will be overridden by the `us-east-2` value. And of course you can add multiple variables in the tfvars. It is not 1 variable = 1 file.


## Best practices

Name your module entry point `main.tf`
Name your input/output variables `interfaces.tf`
Always add a description to variables
